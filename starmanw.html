            Hello there, I am StarmanW. I am an editor on FANDOM. I have been editing on FANDOM since 30 April 2015. My main interest is learning how the technical things work together and helping out FANDOM with cleaning up of any vandalism and spams. In addition, I also help out Wikipedia cleaning up vandalism.
            <br />
            <br /> I personally love to program anything and I always learn new programming language, skills and any security concerns during my spare time. All of my projects can be found at <a id="github-link" href="https://github.com/StarmanW">Github</a>. If you have any inquiries, feel free to contact me at swkf3011@hotmail.com.
